# Factorio CSS

An unofficial CSS framework to make your things look like [Factorio](https://factorio.com).

Created using the design from [FFF #243](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-243). This *will* change when 0.17 comes out (should be early 2019 or earlier), so I won't concentrate on finishing it or making it issue-free before then.

## Usage guidelines

I encourage you to change colors and the background in order to make your site unique and not exactly like Factorio or other sites. It would be a good idea to change many things instead of one thing, as that might just make your site look slightly wrong instead of unique.

I advise against changing the usage of design elements. If you do change something, change all things in that category equally. For example, you can make all the buttons darker. Don't change one design to another design, like default/pressed/hover, since this might cause confusion. Remember that your audience has probably gotten used to looking at Factorio, which you can use to your advantage.
